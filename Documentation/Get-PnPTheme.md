# Get-PnPTheme

## SYNOPSIS
Returns the current theme/composed look of the current web.

## SYNTAX 

```powershell
Get-PnPTheme [-DetectCurrentComposedLook [<SwitchParameter>]]
             [-Web <WebPipeBind>]
             [-Connection <SPOnlineConnection>]
```

## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE 1------------------
```powershell
PS:> Get-PnPTheme
```

Returns the current composed look of the current web.

### ------------------EXAMPLE 2------------------
```powershell
PS:> Get-PnPTheme -DetectCurrentComposedLook
```

Returns the current composed look of the current web, and will try to detect the currently applied composed look based upon the actual site. Without this switch the cmdlet will first check for the presence of a property bag variable called _PnP_ProvisioningTemplateComposedLookInfo that contains composed look information when applied through the provisioning engine or the Set-PnPTheme cmdlet.

### -Web
This parameter allows you to optionally apply the cmdlet action to a subweb within the current web. In most situations this parameter is not required and you can connect to the subweb using Connect-PnPOnline instead. Specify the GUID, server relative url (i.e. /sites/team1) or web instance of the web to apply the command to. Omit this parameter to use the current web.
