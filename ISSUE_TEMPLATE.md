###Notice: many issues / bugs reported are actually related to the PnP Core Library which is used behind the scenes. Consider carefully where to report an issue:###

1. Is the issue related to Apply-SPOProvisioningTemplate or Get-SPOProvisioningTemplate? Then report the issue here: https://github.com/officedev/PnP-Sites-Core/issues. Those cmdlets are merely a thin wrappers around the code provided there and your issue has a bigger chance of being handled correctly when you report it in that repository.
2. Is the issue related to the cmdlet itself, its parameters, the syntax, or do you suspect it's the code of the cmdlet that is causing the issue? Then please continue reporting the issue here.
3. If you think that the functionality might be related to the underlying libraries that the cmdlet is calling (We realize that that might be difficult to determine), please first double check the code of the cmdlet, which can be found here: https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-PowerShell/tree/master/Commands. If related to the cmdlet, continue reporting the issue here, otherwise report the issue at https://github.com/officedev/PnP-Sites-Core/issues
