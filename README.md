# Commands included #
[Navigate here for an overview of all cmdlets and their parameters](Documentation/readme.md)

# Installation #

There are 2 ways to install the cmdlets. We recommend, where possible, to install them from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com). Check out the "Getting Started with the Gallery" section to make sure you have all requirements in place. Alternatively you can download the setup files and install the cmdlets directly.

## PowerShell Gallery ##

If you main OS is Windows 10, of if you have [PowerShellGet](https://github.com/powershell/powershellget) installed, you can run the following commands to install the PowerShell cmdlets:

|**SharePoint Version**|**Command to install**|
|------------------|------------------|
|SharePoint Online|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline ```|
|SharePoint 2016|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell2016```|
|SharePoint 2013|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell2013```|

*Notice*: if you install the latest PowerShellGet from Github, you might receive an error message stating 
>PackageManagement\Install-Package : The version 'x.x.x.x' of the module 'SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline' being installed is not catalog signed.

In order to install the cmdlets when you get this error specify the -SkipPublisherCheck switch with the Install-Module cmdlet, e.g. ```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline -SkipPublisherCheck -AllowClobber```

## Setup files ##
You can download setup files from the [releases](https://github.com/officedev/pnp-powershell/releases) section of the PnP PowerShell repository. These files will up be updated on a monthly basis. Run the install and restart any open instances of PowerShell to use the cmdlets.

# Updating #
Every month a new release will be made available of the PnP PowerShell Cmdlets. If you earlier installed the cmdlets using the setup file, simply download the [latest version](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/releases/latest) and run the setup. This will update your existing installation.

If you have installed the cmdlets using PowerShellGet with ```Install-Module``` from the PowerShell Gallery then you will be able to use the following command to install the latest updated version:

```powershell
Update-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell*
``` 

This will automatically load the module after starting PowerShell 3.0.

You can check the installed PnP-PowerShell versions with the following command:

```powershell
Get-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell* -ListAvailable | Select-Object Name,Version | Sort-Object Version -Descending
```

# Getting started #

To use the library you first need to connect to your tenant:

```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline –Url https://yoursite.sharepoint.com –Credentials (Get-Credential)
```

To view all cmdlets, enter:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module *PnP*
```
